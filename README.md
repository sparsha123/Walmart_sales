Project Title: Time Series Forecasting of Climate Change Data
Course: OPIM 5671 - Data Mining and Business Intelligence
Business Problem:Facing the urgent issue of climate change, our team aimed to predict future global land and ocean temperatures to provide actionable insights.

Task:
Develop and compare time series forecasting models to accurately predict temperature trends, supporting strategic decision-making.

Action:
Data Preparation:
Collected data from Berkeley Earth, covering temperatures from 1750 to 2015.
Cleaned and aggregated data using Python, Excel, and SAS.
Model Development:
City Temperature: Applied Winter’s Additive Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models. Exponential Smoothing outperformed ARIMA (RMSE: 0.42).
Global Temperature: Tested various models, with ARIMA(2,1,2)(1,1,1)s showing the best fit.

Result:
Forecasted a 6.12°F increase in average global temperatures by 2100.
Provided crucial insights for policy formulation and climate action.

Impact:
Policy Support: Informed data-driven environmental policies.
Awareness and Action: Highlighted the severe impacts of climate change, promoting sustainable practices.
Scientific Contribution: Delivered valuable insights for further research and climate mitigation efforts.
Our project leveraged advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to create impactful, accurate models, crucial for understanding and addressing the long-term impacts of climate change.
